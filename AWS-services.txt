1) Amazon EC2                                           - A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
2) Amazon EC2 Autoscaling                               - Allows you to scale EC2 instances up or down
3) Amazon Elastic Container Service(ECS)                - Container orchestration service for Docker container.
4) Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes(EKS) - Makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications using                                                                 Kubernetes.

10) AWS Lambda                                          - Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
11) AWS Serverless Application Repository               - Enables you to quickly deploy code samples, components, complete applications of                                                           common use cases such as web & mobile backends, event & data processing,                                                                   logging, monitoring, IoT etc.
12) Elastic Load Balancing                              - Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.
                                                          1) Application Load Balancer - for http, https traffic
                                                          2) Network Load Balancer - for tcp traffic
